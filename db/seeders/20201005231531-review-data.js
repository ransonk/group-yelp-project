        s I've ever been to in my life, the guy who took my order 
        (blonde tips over his nasty hair) was so damn rude. I ordered a #9 meal, which was supposedly suppose to come with two cheeseburger, only came with one cheeseburger. He was mumbling and not speaking clearly enough for me to hear, I thought he said what sauce, side, etc? Then this rude ass guy started raising his voice at me and was like, "NO, I SAID SIZE!!! Thinking that I don'
        t speak English perhaps ? At that moment,
        I should've just walked out, don
        t nobody raise their voice at a customer.He clearly is not educated enough to be working at "McDonald''s",
        please fire him.You guys will be losing a lot of business from his lack of clarity and unclassy customer service.

There was just as much food as my family would make for a gathering (which is to say tons), and it was just as tasty as I thought it would be. Having our own server and room also totally made the experience (and kept the wine really flowing...not a time to be worried about the budget).

In the pandemic, try the takeout and keep the dream alive that you will one day experience in-person dining like that again.`,

The taste of the chicken was like unexpected bad...it was overcooked and really fat. Fortunately, the chicken came with some vegetables so at least I could eat vegetable with rice. Additionally, the hot and sour soup didn't taste like the traditional one you can get everywhere. To sum up, I won't order here again!`,

This place offers fresh ingredients and full of flavor.  Not easy to park but you can definitely walk right up. Doesn't offer eat in seating but not a big deal. Plenty of spots nearby to sit and enjoy.  I ordered four pies in all and their farro salad.  The salad caught me off guard. It was extremely tasteful. The pizza with greens was amaze-balls`,
